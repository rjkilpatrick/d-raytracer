    The one thing that all ray tracers have is a ray class and a computation of what
    color is seen along a ray. Letâ€™s think of a ray as a function P(t)=A+tb. Here P
    is a 3D position along a line in 3D. A is the ray origin and b is the ray
    direction. The ray parameter t is a real number (double in the code). Plug in a
    different t and P(t) moves the point along the ray. Add in negative t values and
    you can go anywhere on the 3D line. For positive t, you get only the parts in
    front of A, and this is what is often called a half-line or ray.
